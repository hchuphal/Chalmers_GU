I am unable to ssh to a server that asks for a diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange method:

ssh 123.123.123.123
Unable to negotiate with 123.123.123.123 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
How to enable the diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange method on Debian 8.0?

I have tried (as proposed here) to

add the following lines to my /etc/ssh/ssh_config

KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group1-sha1,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
Ciphers 3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,aes128-cbc,aes128-ctr,aes256-ctr
regenerate keys with

ssh-keygen -A
restart ssh with

service ssh restart
