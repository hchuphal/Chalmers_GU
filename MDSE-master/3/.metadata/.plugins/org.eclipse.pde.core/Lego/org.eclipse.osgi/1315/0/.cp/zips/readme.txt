This folder is a placeholder for the QVTd example project ZIPs

For a Tycho build, the ZIPs are built by a buildZips.xml invocation from maven-antrun in pom.xml.

For interactive Eclipse usage, the buildZips.xml may be run as Run->External Tools->QVTd Example ZIPs.
The QVTd Example ZIPs should run automatically when the project is built.
