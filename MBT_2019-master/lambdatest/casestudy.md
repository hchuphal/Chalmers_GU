## Part 2. Case study - Find a software/lib that uses the testing tool (LambdaTest)

**Q2.1. What is the purpose of the sw/lib, i.e. what does it aim to do for users/developers?**

LambdaTest testing platform is not a code library or open source downloadable tool. It's a pure oncloud platform that can used for web manual and automation testing. It is a cross browser compatibility testing platform that can help testers perform live interactive realtime manual testing as well as run selenium automation scripts on a cloud based infrastructure having 2000+ browser environments. For manual testing testers get instant access to machines running browser environment of our choice. For automation testing, LambdaTest is providing an on-cloud selenium grid that can be used to run selenium automation test scripts on 2000+ different browser environments. It is a cloud testing platform which allows users to test their website or web application across a wide range of browsers, browser versions, operating systems, screen resolutions, and desktop and mobile devices for cross browser compatibility.


**Q2.2. What are the key technologies used to develop the lib?**

For manual testing, LambdaTest platform can be used for testing any website or webpage no matter the technology it's build with. For automation LambdaTest platform supports all selenium supported languages and frameworks. Testers can use any selenium supported testing framework or programming language. LambdaTest Live has all major developer debugging tools like Firebug, Web Developer, YSlow etc. For complete list of Developer tools that comes pre-installed with the browsers. Supported technologies include Java, C/C++, PHP, HTML, C#, Python, JavaScript, CSS.


**Q2.3. What kind of automated testing tools are used to test the sw/lib (including but possible more than LambdaTest tool) and what are their key features?**

LambdaTest platform is an online selenium automation grid with 2000+ different browser environments as it's nodes. The platform helps in cross browser compatibility testing as well as in cutting down on test execution time. The main advantage of using LambdaTest is that testers don't have to maintain selenium testing infrastructure on their own. The tools handles that for testers.


**Q2.4. Which features of the automated testing tools are currently used by the test suite?**

On-cloud Selenium grid, Live Browser Testing, Multiple Browser Support, Resolution Display Testing, Dev Environment Local Testing, Screenshot Testing, and Collaboration

**Q2.5. Which features of the automated testing tools are NOT used by the test suite?**

Mobile app testing and performance testing features.


## Part 3. Interview developers/testers of LambdaTest tool

**Q3.1. Reach out to the developers of LambdaTest tool and ask them about their reasons for developing LambdaTest tool. Why this particular type of testing technology? Which situations is it good for and less good for?**

LambdaTest was built with the aim of bringing all testing activities to a single integrated cloud platform. Right now each aspect of testing such as browser testing, automation testing, api testing etc are performed at different tools and platforms which forces developers and testers to constantly switch between platforms. LambdaTest aims to bring all these activities to a single integrated platform one feature at a time. Right now the tool is live with cross browser testing features and selenium automation testing features. The platform is useful for web cross browser compatibility testing, responsive testing, and web automation testing.

**Q3.2 Ask them how mature they think LambdaTest tool is? Is it suitable for use by companies developing real-world software at scale? Why / why not?**

LambdaTest platform is live since November 2017. Since then we have an user base of 50000+ active users. We have active customers from all industry sizes ranging from startups to large scale enterprises. The platform is used by both B2B and B2C applications of small to large scales.


**Q3.3. Ask them how they plan to evolve and develop LambdaTest tool going forward. What are the main improvements needed to take the tool to the next level?**

LambdaTest aims to bring the whole testing ecosystem to an integrated cloud platform. The company has a roadmap planned for as far as 2021 and  are working one step at a time to achieve this goal. Right now they are live with web cross browser testing and automation testing. They are now working in bringing mobile app testing, performance testing and API testing features on our platform. They have integrations with 17+ platforms and are adding 1-2 new integrations every month.
